A custom Gutenberg block that dynamically displays a list of subpages for the current page.

== Description ==

**Subpages List Block** is a lightweight WordPress block that dynamically lists the child pages (subpages) of the current page.  

✔ **Displays a list of child pages dynamically**  
✔ **Adds "current-menu-item" class to the active subpage**  
✔ **Uses `get_block_wrapper_attributes()` for full compatibility**  
✔ **Supports block styles and alignments**  
✔ **Improves page navigation within hierarchical structures**  

This block is useful for websites that use a **hierarchical page structure**, such as business sites, documentation, and educational content.
